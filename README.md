# DatagenDV

DatagenDV is a Python framework for generating C compatible test stimulus using YAML and random
constraints. The framework leverages multiple open-source projects by tying them together into base classes which can then be
extended by its users.

DatagenDV was made open source to provide an example of how python frameworks can be made with verifiation in mind. 
Although designed to be generic and project agnostic, it is not intended for easy plug and play into any project infrastructure at this time. 
It is one way of doing things and is aimed a particular flow.  
DatagenDV is better utilized as an example and starting point.

Please see the examples directory which contain Jupyter notebooks which explain and show how it is used.
For a fuller explanation of DatagenDV's features see the 2023 DVCon paper.
